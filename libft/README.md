# c_standard_library
-- A collection of c standard functions --

The first project of the 42 Core-Curriculum is to create a collection of standard C functions.
A deeper understanding of the functionality and the advantages and disadvantages of these functions is necessary to create secure and stable programs.
This library will be updated, expanded and used during future Projects of the Curriculum.
